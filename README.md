# Model-of-wealth-Accumulation

We propose here a program in order to simulate the behaviour of the model of wealth accumulation described by Weibull and Gibaud (2017).

The preprint is described in ArXiv : https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.00996


The parameters are : 
- v,c,y,delta described in the Model
- N the number of individuals
- T the number of occurence of the main Poisson Process
- Wealth_Strengh is a boolean. When it is True, the program simulates the Model when wealth is strengh (see Section ...).
- lamda is the lambda used in Section Wealth is Strengh. (lambda is already used in Native Python)

The program needs to run the following libraries : random, matplotlib, numpy.
